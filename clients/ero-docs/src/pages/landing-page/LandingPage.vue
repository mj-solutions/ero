        Ero is an aggregator and notifier of graphics card stock information
        across multiple swedish retailers. It was created as a means of finding
        out about releases of graphics cards during the 2021 shortage. The Ero
        system consists of four interconnected parts: a backend which crawls a
        number of retailers for the current status of their graphics cards stock
        and pushes the latest data to a cloud database, an API which reads from
        that same database, a frontend which uses the API to give an overview of
        the current graphics cards availability, and finally a bot using both
        email and Telegram to report new findings as soon as they appear.

        }"
        class="rounded-xl p-1 bg-opacity-30 transition-colors"
      >
        The web frontend together with the reporting bot proved a reliable
        package solution to quickly find out about new graphics cards releases,
        and it did in fact help us and a number of our acquaintances to get our
        hands on graphics cards at a time when it for many seemed impossible to
        do so. (hover me ðŸ’–)

        We have decided to shut down our instance of ero however the source code
        is available on
        <a href="https://github.com/mjnord/ero" class="text-[#6366f1]">
          github.com
        </a>
        for anyone to use.
